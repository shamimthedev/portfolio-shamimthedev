          Hi, I'm Md. Shamim Hossain, a passionate Frontend Developer from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I believe that coding is a powerful way to turn ideas into reality. With a strong foundation in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Next.js, I love building interactive, user-friendly websites that not only look great but also deliver seamless experiences.
        </p>
        <p className="max-w-[900px] text-[16px] text-justify text-[#666] mb-6">
          Whether it’s crafting pixel-perfect UI with Tailwind CSS or experimenting with modern frontend tools like SASS and SCSS, I’m always ready to take on the next challenge. My toolbox includes Git for version control, and I’m comfortable collaborating and sharing projects on GitHub.
        </p>
        <p className="max-w-[900px] text-[16px] text-justify text-[#666]">
          When I’m not coding, you’ll find me traveling to new places, finding inspiration, or writing about my experiences and learnings. I strive to continuously improve my skills, and my goal is to create websites that blend functionality and aesthetics. Let’s create something amazing together!
